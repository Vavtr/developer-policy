# GitHub Policy: Fighting for developers

As the home for all developers, GitHub is committed to shaping policies that promote their interests and the future of software. We work on policy in its many forms -- laws, regulations, norms, and standard practices -- to fight for developers and their rights to innovation, collaboration, and equal opportunity.

The GitHub Policy Team created and maintains this repository as a place for developers to contribute to our policy work. We want to hear from you!

## How can I help?

We are interested in what you think we can do to best help developers. We want to hear about policy opportunities and new policy areas that you think GitHub should pursue to advance developersâ€™ rights to innovation, collaboration, and equal opportunity. Please check out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening an Issue.

## Follow GitHub Policy

Periodically we will update content here to highlight our work for developers. You can also visit our [webpage](#holder), read our [policy blog](https://github.blog/category/company/policy/), and follow us on Twitter at [@GitHubPolicy](https://twitter.com/githubpolicy).
