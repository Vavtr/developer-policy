# Global collaboration
We support developers to work with anyone, anywhere because building and maintaining useful, secure software is a group effort that transcends borders. We work to reduce policy barriers to global collaboration and to demonstrate the local benefits that globally connected developers deliver.

## Our approach
We engage policymakers to reduce the impact that trade restrictions, including sanctions and export controls, have on developers and their ability to collaborate. As part of this effort, we also support think tanks and researchers to demonstrate the value that global software collaboration brings, especially to local communities and national governments. In administering our platform, we try to make as many features on GitHub available to as many developers around the world as possible.

Some examples of our past work on global collaboration:
- [GitHub has secured a license to fully serve Iranian developers](https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-github-is-fully-available-in-iran/) 
- [We argue for open innovation as a way to address calls for digital sovereignty](https://thenewstack.io/bad-policies-around-open-innovation-will-cripple-economic-prosperity/)  
- [GitHub complies with sanctions while aiming to reduce their impact on developers as much as possible](https://github.blog/2019-09-12-global-software-collaboration-in-the-face-of-sanctions/)
