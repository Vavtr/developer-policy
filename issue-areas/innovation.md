# Innovation
We advocate for copyright, patent, and employment rules that further developers’ interests and the software ecosystem as a whole. We aim to lead by example with the policies that we administer on our platform and for our employees.

## Our approach
We engage policymakers, courts, and other venues to ensure that the developer perspective is considered whenever innovation policies change. On our own platform, we run a developer-first [DMCA takedown process](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/dmca-takedown-policy). For example, we do not automatically disable forks when disabling a parent repository because forks belong to different users, may have been altered in significant ways, and may be licensed or used in a different way that is protected by fair use.


Some examples of our past work on innovation:
- [GitHub refers developers to independent legal counsel when confronted with DMCA 1201 claims](https://github.blog/2021-07-27-github-developer-rights-fellowship-stanford-law-school/)
- [We assed what Google v. Oracle meant for developers](https://github.blog/2021-04-06-supreme-court-sides-with-developers-in-google-v-oracle/)
- [GitHub filed a comment with the U.S. Copyright Office rulemaking on DMCA 1201 exemptions](https://github.blog/2021-03-15-fud-chills-github-stands-with-security-researchers-on-dmca-section-1201/) and [explains how developers can do so as well](https://github.blog/2020-11-19-take-action-dmca-anti-circumvention-and-developer-innovation/)
- [We open sourced GitHub’s Balanced Employee IP Agreement that provides clarity in contributing to projects](https://github.blog/2020-12-14-inspired-by-open-source-balanced-employee-intellectual-property-agreement-2-0/)
- [We joined a letter to the U.S. Senate to weigh in on needed reform to the way patents are challenged and assessed](https://www.uspto.gov/sites/default/files/documents/11192020GitHubInc.pdf)
- [GitHub worked to gain an exemption for open source developers in the EU Copyright Directive](https://github.blog/2018-10-23-github-goes-to-brussels/) and [help developers get engaged directly](https://github.blog/2018-09-10-how-developers-can-defend-open-source-from-the-eu-copyright-proposal/)
