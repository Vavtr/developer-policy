# Inclusion
At GitHub, we take a holistic approach to [diversity, inclusion, and belonging](https://github.com/about/diversity) by aligning our efforts across our platform, people, philanthropy and policy efforts. Policy plays a critical role in lowering barriers and providing access for current and future developers from underrepresented backgrounds and regions.  

## Our approach
We support social sector organizations and grassroots efforts, intervene in court cases, and engage policymakers on policies that ensure opportunities for anyone to become a developer. This fosters the developer community to better reflect the vibrant diversity of our world. GitHub leverages its voice, resources and position in the ecosystem to advocate for voting rights, immigration reform, and net neutrality, among other issues.

Some examples of our past work on inclusion:
- [GitHub rallied developers to promote voter turnout in the 2020 U.S. Election](https://github.blog/2020-11-02-commit-your-vote-on-election-day/)
- [GitHub joined court briefs to support developers’ and students’ ability to immigrate to the U.S.]( https://github.blog/2021-02-03-fighting-for-developers-github-policy-2020-in-review/#tech-inclusion)
- [GitHub supported and helped mobilize developers on net neutrality in the U.S.](https://github.blog/2018-08-01-net-neutrality-updates-from-india-and-the-us/) and more recently [filed a comment in Mexico](http://www.ift.org.mx/sites/default/files/industria/temasrelevantes/consultaspublicas/documentos/20-07-15-373github.pdf)
