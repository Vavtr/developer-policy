# Platform responsibility
We aim to protect developers’ ability to collaborate by ensuring changes to intermediary liability rules and safe harbors affecting developer collaboration platforms do not impose requirements to proactively filter or increase takedowns of code. We strive to provide a safe and inclusive space that transparently respects rights to free expression, assembly, and association.

## Our approach
Our primary message to policymakers is that “code is different.” In contrast to other hosted content, code is less likely to be abusive content and is more likely to have open copyright licenses attached to it. The harms imposed by filtering or taking down code content are also different than the content hosted on most platforms: projects have dependencies on one-another and thus one takedown can have effects on countless more. 

Some examples of our past work on platform responsibility:
- [GitHub scores high in content moderation report from EFF](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-github-scores-high-in-content-moderation-report/)
- Our legislative and tracking efforts on safe harbors for software collaboration, [part 1 (focused on the US)](https://github.blog/2020-10-06-safe-harbors-for-software-collaboration-part-1/) and [part 2 (focused globally)](https://github.blog/2021-04-08-safe-harbors-for-software-collaboration-part-2/)
