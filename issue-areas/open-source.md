# Open source
GitHub is the home for much of the world’s open source development. We believe that collaborative development through the open source process accelerates innovation.

## Our approach
GitHub fights for open source to ensure the world’s open source code is available and accessible for everyone to use, modify, and learn from. We provide open source legal tools and policy analysis to the community. We also engage policymakers to ensure that their policies and laws enable and encourage the use of open source.

Some examples of our past work on open source
- [We open sourced a tool to help scale project governance](https://github.blog/2021-07-22-minimum-viable-governance-lightweight-community-structure-foss-projects/)
- [We provided analysis of the trend towards ‘source available’ licenses](https://github.blog/2021-03-18-whats-up-with-these-new-not-open-source-licenses/)
- [GitHub offered comments to the U.S. NTIA on promoting open source in 5G](https://github.blog/2021-02-23-open-source-in-the-5g-stack/)
- [We joined a petition to save the Open Technology Fund, which funds open source software for the public good](https://github.blog/2020-07-02-github-supports-the-open-technology-fund/) 
- [GitHub joined the GPL Cooperation Commitment](https://github.blog/2018-11-07-github-joins-gpl-cooperation-commitment/)
