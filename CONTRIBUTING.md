# Contributing

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to our Policy work to advance the interests of developers and the future of software. Be sure to read our [README](README.md) -- it describes the project and its purpose. 

We welcome Issues on the following topics:
- Policy opportunities for GitHub to advance developersâ€™ rights to innovation, collaboration, and equal opportunity, particularly in our priority policy areas stated on our [website](#holder). These should be concrete actions for us to take: support a bill, submit a regulatory filing, join an industry coalition, or the like.
- Additional policy areas that GitHub should consider engaging on in order to support developers.

To keep the conversation focused on how we can best help developers through our policy work, we moderate off-topic content. GitHub maintains a number of ways for you to get in touch on other topics, including:
- You can review changes to our site policies and offer feedback in our [dedicated repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy)
- You can share feedback on our products using our dedicated [feedback repository](https://github.com/github/feedback)

Contributions to this project are dedicated to the public domain under [CC0-1.0](LICENSE.md).

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.
