Hi GitHub Policy, I have a policy suggestion that I’d :heart: your :eyes: on!

- [ ] I have read the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] I have reviewed your priorities and examples of past work at [developer-policy/issue-areas](https://github.com/github/developer-policy/issue-areas)

### What are you asking us to do?

### Why do you think this is important for developers?

### Where is this? Which jurisdictions does this impact?

### Who else is involved? Are there other groups that we should consider partnering with?

### Is there anything else we should know about your suggestion?
