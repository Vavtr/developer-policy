Hi GitHub Policy, I have a policy suggestion that I’d :heart: your :eyes: on!

- [ ] I have read the (Contributing Guidelines)[CONTRIBUTING.md]
- [ ] I have reviewed your website that describes GitHub’s policy priorities

### What are you asking us to do?

### Why do you think this is important for developers?

### Where is this? Which jurisdictions does this impact?

### Who else is involved? Are there other groups that we should consider partnering with?

### Is there anything else we should know about your suggestion?
